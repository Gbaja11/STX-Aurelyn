# STX-Aurelyn - Asset Smart Contract

This smart contract implements a comprehensive token system on the [Stacks blockchain](https://www.stacks.co/), written in [Clarity](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/clarity). It supports the creation, transfer, and authorization of fungible tokens, along with tracking balances, token price history, and admin-level controls.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Structures

### Maps

* `tokens`: Stores metadata for each token
* `balances`: Tracks balances of users per token
* `allowances`: Records delegated spending rights
* `price-history`: Maintains historical prices with timestamps

### Variables

* `token-counter`: Auto-incremented ID for tokens
* `contract-admin`: Owner of the contract (set at deployment)

## üõ†Ô∏è Contract Initialization

When deployed, the contract sets the `contract-admin` to `tx-sender` (the deploying address).
